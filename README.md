 ## My first project in GitHub 

### How to start a GitHub project?

1. First, you need a GitHub account
2. On your home page (github.com), click on start a project (github.com/new)
3. Add a Repository name, a description (nice!), make it public (I think that private is for premium accounts) and add a README.txt file (this file). Then click Create Repository
4. In the next page, click the green button "code" and click "Open with GitHub Desktop
5. Install GitHub Desktop
6. Open GitHub Desktop. You will see your list of projects in the Repository. Go into your new repository.
7. On the top menu, go into Repository -> open with Visual Studio Code
8. Install Visual Studio Code
9. Intall Git https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
10. In VS code, install the extensions Git Graph and GitHub Pull Requests and Issues
11. In VS code, open a new terminal and create a new branch from main an modify your code (git branch your_local_branch_name)
12. Git add . 
13. Git commit (and write a nice and structure commit message)
14. Git push or git push origin your_local_branch_name:your_remote_branch_name
15. Go to GitHub.com and check your branch. You can see for how many commits you branch is ahead from main.
16. You can do a PR into main. Review it and if you are happy with the changes, merge it into main
17. Go back to VS code. Do git checkout main and then do git pull. You can also do it from Git Graph

### Good practice:
1. Create a virtual environment for each of your project
2. Add a version file and increase the version in each commit

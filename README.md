How to start a GitHub project?

1. First, you need a GitHub account
3. On your home page (github.com), click on start a project (github.com/new)
    4. Add a Repository name, a description (nice!), make it public (I think that private is for premium accounts) and add a README.txt file (this file :)). Then click Create Repository
    5. In the next page, click the green button "code" and click "Open with GitHub Desktop
6. Install GitHub Desktop
7. Open GitHub Desktop. You will see your list of Repositoris. Go into your new repository.
8. On the top menu, go into Repository -> open with Visual Studio Code
9. Install Visual Studio Code
10. Intall Git https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
11.  In VS code, install the extensions Git Graph and GitHub Pull Requests and Issues
12. And now... I am testing GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

Good practice:
1. Create a virtual environment for each of your project
2. Add a version file and increase the version in each commit
